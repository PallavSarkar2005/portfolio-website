# portfolio-website

This project is built using **React + Vite**.

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- @vitejs/plugin-react — uses Babel / oxc for Fast Refresh  
- @vitejs/plugin-react-swc — uses SWC for Fast Refresh  

## React Compiler

The React Compiler is not enabled in this template because of its impact on dev & build performance.  
To enable it, see: https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler/installation

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled.  
See the TS template: https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts
